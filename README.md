podsy
=====

features
--------
- the index page is like the front page of reddit or youtube--it 
  displays the top pods of the most popular categories
- if logged in, the index page will also show a list of posts
  from users you follow
- the index page has a list of categories, truncated by most popular
- like reddit/youtube, you can listen to pods without creating an
  account, but you need an account to create posts/upload pods
- again, like reddit, posts are either pods hosted directly on
  podsy's servers or are links to podcasts hosted elsewhere
- clicking on a pod takes you to a screen that makes it very easy
  to play the audio, i.e. a big play button, a title, and a link
  for more info...no more navigating through a whole blog post just
  to find a tiny play button that's too small to tap on a mobile device
- creating a post is an easy, streamlined process--create a title,
  assign to a category, and either select an audio file from your
  machine or paste a link to an existing podcast/audio file
- mobile apps have a record feature--press record, do your talk, press
  stop, add a title, assign to a category, press upload
- subscribe to categories and follow users
- search by category, hit count, or pod length
